This is just a bunch of pending issues, mostly with Windows because
Windows is a royal pain.

For python, there is an issue if you get an exception and another
python callback gets called.  The exception is cleared by the new
python call so it is lost.  So even though exceptions are propagated
back through the C/C++ code, they can still get lost.  You can see
this in test_mdns.py if there are multiple callbacks to mdns_cb.
There is not an easy workaround, it is probably better to catch
exceptions in all callbacks.

Windows has some strange behavior that I can't track down dealing with
socket closing.  It looks like in some cases that a close won't be
reported in winsock_func() if the source and destination sockets are
both in the same process.  That seems to be why
test_ssl_tcp_accept_connect.py fails, I have verified that one side of
the connection gets closed but the close is not reported on the other
side.

On Windows, a new pty spews out a bunch of terminal control stuff and
messes things up for testing and for things like rsync.  Some way to
disable this is needed.  This breaks test_pty_basic.py.  See

You get strange behavior from Windows stdio if you have the console
you are using in raw mode on the console and open another program
using stdio.  For instance:
   $ gensiot -i stdio(self,raw) stdio,cmd
   Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.3208]
   (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

   C:\msys64\home\cminyard\gensio>
but you can't type anything.  If you take out the "raw", it works, but
then you get the undesirable side effects of a non-raw console.  And
it makes running programs from an application a program if the
application is in raw mode.

On Windows, python tests pull gensios from the installed directory,
not from the local directory.  This is because Windows always loads
shared libraries first from the directory the original program ran in,
and if you have gensio installed, it's going to be in the same
directory as python.  So if you have gensio installed this way, you
have to install it again before you run tests.
