.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR gensiotool
program allows connections to be made using gensios  It creates two gensios
called
.I io1
and
.I io2.
.I io1
is by default the local terminal and io2 must be specified.
.PP
By default,
.BR gensiotool
make two normal gensios and establishes connections to each of them.  Any
data that comes in on one gensio is transmitted on the other.

For a description of how to specify a gensio, see the gensio documentation.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-i|\-\-input io1"
By default io1 is the local terminal (
.BR /dev/tty
) for a tty stdin, or the program's stdin/stdout for a non-tty stdin.
This lets another gensio be specified as the device hook to io2.
.TP
.I "\-a|\-\-accepter"
By default io2 make an outgoing connection.  This modifies io2 to
be a gensio accepter and waits for an incoming connection.  Once
the connection comes in, the accepter is closed and operations
proceeds as normal.
.TP
.I \-\-signature
Serial server signature reported to the remote end.  If an accepter is
specified (currently only a telnet RFC2217 server) the signature given
is used instead of "gensiotool".
.TP
.I \-d|\-\-debug
Generate debugging output.  Specifying more than once increases the output.
.TP
.I \-e|\-\-escchar char
Specify a character to use for the escape character.  Setting it to
zero disables the escape character.  This can either be a decimal or
hexadeximal number or ^x to set a control character.  By default it is
^\\ if io1 is the default and stdin is a tty, or disabled otherwise.
See ESCAPES below for more details on the escape character.  Only handled
on io1.
.TP
.I \-h|\-\-help
Help output

.SH "ESCAPES"
If the escape character is received on io1, the character is not transferred
and the program waits for another character.  If the other character is
also the escape character, a single escape character is sent.  If the
other character is not recognized as a valid escape, it is ignore and not
transferred.  Upper and lower case are equivalent.

Escape characters are:
.TP
.B q
Quit the program.
.TP
.B b
Send a break to io2.  Ignored if io2 does not support break.
.TP
.B d
Dump serial data for io2.  Ignored if io2 is not a serial gensio.
.TP
.B s
Set the serial port (baud) rate for io2.  Ignored if io2 is not a
serial gensio.  After this, the serial port speed must be blind typed,
terminated by a new line.  Use escchar-d to know if you set it right.
.TP
.B n, o, e
Set the parity on io2 to none, odd, or even.  Ignored if io2 is not a
serial gensio.
.TP
.B 7, 8
Set the data size on io2 to 7 or 8 bits.  Ignored if io2 is not a
serial gensio.
.TP
.B 1, 2
Set the number of stop bits to 1 or 2 on io2 bits.  Ignored if io2 is
not a serial gensio.
