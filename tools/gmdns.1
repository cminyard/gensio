.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR gmdns
program allows you to advertise an mDNS service or query for mDNS
services on the local network.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-n|\-\-name str"
The name field for the service/query.
.TP
.I "\-t|\-\-type str"
The type field for the service/query.
.TP
.I "\-m|\-\-domain str"
The domain field for the service/query.
.TP
.I "\-o|\-\-host str"
The host field for the service/query.
.TP
.I "\-i|\-\-interface num"
The interface number for the service/query.  If -1, service/query all
the interfaces on the system.  Defaults to -1.
.TP
.I "\-y|\-\-nettype unspec|ipv4|ipv6"
The network type for the service/query.  If unspec, the service/query
is for IPv4 and IPv6.  Otherwise it's only for the specified protocol.
Defaults to unspec.
.TP
.I "\-s|\-\-service"
Advertise a network service instead of doing a query.  In this case,
the name, type, and port options must be provided.  The others are
optional and should not be provided unless you need them.
.TP
.I "\-x|\-\-txt str"
Add the string to the set of text strings advertised for a service.
Only makes sense with -s.
.TP
.I "\-p|\-\-port str"
Use the given port for the advertised service.  Only make sense with -s.
.TP
.I "\-c|\-\-close-on-done"
For a query, after all currently known services are reported, exit.
.TP
.I "\-\-timeout time"
The amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, before closing everything
and terminating.
.TP
.I \-d|\-\-debug
Generate debugging output.  Specifying more than once increases the output.
.TP
.I \-h|\-\-help
Help output

.SH "STRING VALUES FOR QUERIES"
The string values for queries may use regular expressions or globs.
If the string starts with '%', then the data after it is treated as a
regular expression and fields are matched against that.  If the string
starts with '@', the the data after it is treated as a standard glob.
See the regex(7) and glob(7) man pages for details.

If the string starts with '=', an exact comparison is done with the
data after it.

If the string starts with a-z0-9_ or a space, then an exact string
comparison is done, including the first character.

The behavior of matching for any other starting character is
undefined.  In general, you should always use '@', '%', or '=' as the
starting character of all your query strings to be sure.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH "KNOWN PROBLEMS"
None.
