.SH NAME
gtlsshd \- Server for shell over TLS

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gtlsshd [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR gtlsshd
program receives connections from gtlssh, authenticates the
connections, and connects them to a shell or a program as requested.

.BR gtlsshd
will listen on both SCTP and TCP sockets unless told otherwise.

.BR gtlsshd
uses openssl public key certificate authentication both
directions.  When something connections, it uses standard SSL handling
to validate itself to the user with the given key and certificate
files.

On SSL does its job, it then runs an authentication protocol for the
user on top of the SSL connection.  The user sends the username, and
gtlsshd will use the $HOME/.gtlssh/allowed_certs directory to
authenticate a certificate the user presents.  If the user doesn't
have a certificate that matches the presented certificate,
.BR gtlsshd
will attempt a normal password login if that is enabled.
.SH WINDOWS HACKS
See "WINDOWS HACKS" in the gtlssh-keygen.1 man page for information
about special windows configuration.
.SH TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION
.BR gtlsshd
supports two-factor authentication in a number of ways.  The certauth
gensio supports sending a second authentication token, gtlsshd will
pick that up and use it if PAM asks for it.  If it's not there but PAM
asks for it, it will interactively prompt the user for the token
unless
.I \-\-nointeractive
is specified.

This requires, of course, proper PAM setup.  It also direclty supports
second authentication tokens with certificates.  You can specify a
different PAM authentication script for logins done with certificates
using
.I \-\-pam\-cert\-auth
to allow a second factor to be added for just certificate
authentications.

You can request that the other end prompt for a second-factor
authentication token and send it along with the password by adding the
.I \-\-do\-2fa
option.  This will cause the other end to always ask for a second
factor.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-p|\-\-port port
Use the given port instead of the default port.
.TP
.I \-h|\-\-keyfile file
Use the given file for the key instead of the default.  Defaults to
sysconfidr/gtlssh/gtlsshd.key.  On unix sysconfdir is generally /etc.
On Windows it is one directory up from the executable with /etc appended.
.TP
.I \-c|\-\-certfile file
Set the certificate to use.  Defaults to sysconfdir/gtlssh/gtlsshd.crt.
On unix sysconfdir is generally /etc.  On Windows it is one directory up
from the executable with /etc appended.
.TP
.I \-\-permit\-root
Allow root logins.  Otherwise root or uid=0 is denied.
.TP
.I \-\-allow\-password
Allow password logins.  By default only certificate-based logins
are allowed.  Passwords are much less secure than certificate
logins, so their use is discouraged.
.TP
.I \-\-require\-password
Require a password in addition to certificate logins.  This is
primarily for Windows systems that really need a password to be able
to log in properly.

On Unix system, you generally use PAM for this, but if you set up PAM
to require passwords even with certificates, you should also set this
option so the password is transferred as part of the authentication
protocol and not interactively.
.TP
.I \-\-do\-2fa
Enable 2-factor authentication.  This means that 2-factor
authentication is enabled in PAM for gtlssh.  This will cause the
client end to request 2-factor data and transmit it over along with
the password.  During authentication, it is expected that PAM will
request two authentication tokens and the first will be the password
(if certificate failed).  Note that this is not required to do
2-factor auth, but is useful to allow gtlssh to read the 2-factor data
and transfer it as part of the login data.
.TP
.I \-\-pam\-cert\-auth <name>
If the connection is authorized with a certificate, still do a PAM
authentication, but use the given name as the program name for PAM to
use to find the rules.  This will allow 2-factor auth to be done on a
certificate login, as the given set of rules can be written to only
do the second factor authentication part.
.TP
.I \-\-pam\-service <name>
Use the given name for the pam service, instead of using the program's name.
.TP
.I \-\-use\-login, \-\-no\-use\-login
Use or do not use the login program to log the user in.  Some systems
work better with login, others work fine to directly execute the
shell.  The default depends on the system and should be best.
.TP
.I \-\-oneshot
Do not fork the program at the beginning or when a connection is
received.  This allows easier debugging of the program.
.TP
.I \-\-nodaemon
Do not daemonize (double fork) the program.
.TP
.I \-\-nointeractive
Disable interactive logins.  All authentication information must be
passed in via the protocol.  This is different than gtlssh's view of
interactive, which affects how I/O is done.  This only affects
prompting for credentials interactively.
.TP
.I \-\-nosctp
Disable SCTP support.
.TP
.I \-\-notcp
Disable TCP support
.TP
.I \-\-other_acc <accepter>
Enable the given accepter to receive connections for gtlsshd.  This
does not disable TCP or SCTP.
.TP
.I \-P|\-\-pidfile file
Create a standard pidfile using the given filename.
.TP
.I \-4
Do IPv4 only.
.TP
.I \-6
Do IPv6 only.
.TP
.I \-m, \-\-enable\-mdns
Enable MDNS service for this device.  This allows gtlssh to find this with
"gtlssh -m <name>".
.TP
.I \-\-mdns\-name <name>
Sets the name used for finding this connection with mdns.  The default
is the first part of the hostname, before the first '.', if any.
.TP
.I \-\-startup\-retries
The number of times gtlsshd will retry creating the accepter.  It
retries once a second. Generally, if creating the accepter fails, that
means the nameserver is not yet operational and converting the local
name to an address fails, so this can help with the resolver not being
ready when gtlsshd starts.  Default is 30.
.TP
.I \-d|\-\-debug
Generate debugging output.  Specifying more than once increases the output.
This also causes syslog output to go to standard error.
.TP
.I \-\-version
Print the version number and exit.
.TP
.I \-h|\-\-help
Help output
