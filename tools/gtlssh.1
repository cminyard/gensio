.TH gtlssh 1 01/02/19  "Shell connection over TLS"

.SH NAME
gtlssh \- Shell connection  over TLS

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gtlssh [options] <host> [<program>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR gtlssh
program connects to a remote server, authenticates the remote server
using SSL, then authenticates itself with the server.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-p|\-\-port port
Use the given port instead of the default port.
.TP
.I \-i|\-\-keyfile file
Use the given file for the key instead of the default.  If you specify
this, the certfile will be the same name ending in .crt, unless you
specify it explicitly.
.TP
.I \-\-certfile file
Set the certificate to use
.TP
.I \-e|\-\-escchar char
Specify a character to use for the escape character.  Setting it to
-1 disables the escape character.  This can either be a decimal or
hexadeximal number or ^x to set a control character.  By default it is
^\\ if io1 is the default and stdin is a tty, or disabled otherwise.
See ESCAPES below for more details on the escape character.  Only handled
on io1.
.TP
.I \-r|\-\-telnet
Do telnet processing with RFC2217 handling.
.I \-d|\-\-debug
Generate debugging output.  Specifying more than once increases the output.
.TP
.I \-h|\-\-help
Help output

.SH "HOST AUTHENTICATION"
After connecting, the host is first validated using standard SSL.  The
keys used for validation are in $HOME/.gtlssh/server_certs by default.
If the given key is not recognized, the user is prompted with the
certificate fingerprint asking if the user wants to acccept the
certificate.

If the user accepts the certificate, then it is added into the default
directory.  If not, the connection is terminated.

Certificates are stored in the form "<hostname>,<port>.crt" and
"<ipaddress>,<port>.crt".  Both are created for a connection (unless
connecting with an IP address).  A connection is verified as matching
both entries, if the certificate in the file does not match the
certificate from the remote end, the connection is terminated and the
user informed.

.SH "USER AUTHENTICATION"
If host authentication succeeds,
.BR gtlssh
authenticates itself with a key and certificate.  These files are
fetch by default from $HOME/.gtlssh/keycerts in the form
<host>[,<port>].key and <host>[,<port>].crt.  If the form with the
host and port exists, that is taken.  Otherwise if the form with just
the host exists, it is taken.  Otherwise it defaults to
$HOME/.gtlssh/default.key and $HOME/.gttlssh/default.crt.

The remote end looks in $HOME/.gtlssh/allowed_certs for the
certificate.  If the remote end does not have the certificate
presented, then password authentication is tried.

.SH "ITERACTIVE MODE"
If the stdin for
.BR gtlssh
is a tty and no program is given to run, then the login is an
interactive login.  Any sort of delay in I/O processing is disabled,
and the local terminal is used for I/O and it is put into raw mode

In non-interactive mode, the local side uses stdio for local I/O and
I/O processing delay on the network side is not disabled.  This is
useful for programs transferring data over the connection.

.SH "ESCAPES"
If the escape character is received from the user, the character is
not transferred and the program waits for another character.  If the
other character is also the escape character, a single escape
character is sent.  If the other character is not recognized as a
valid escape, it is ignore and not transferred.  Upper and lower case
are equivalent.

Escape characters are:
.TP
.B q
Quit the program.
.TP
.B b
Send a break to io2.  Ignored if io2 does not support break.
.TP
.B d
Dump serial data for io2.  Ignored if io2 is not a RFC2217 capable.
.TP
.B s
Set the serial port (baud) rate for io2.  Ignored if io2 is not
RFC2177 capable.  After this, the serial port speed must be typed,
terminated by a new line.  Invalid speeds are ignore, use escchar-d to
know if you set it right.
.TP
.B n, o, e
Set the parity on io2 to none, odd, or even.  Ignored if io2 is not
RFC2217 capable.
.TP
.B 7, 8
Set the data size on io2 to 7 or 8 bits.  Ignored if io2 is not
RFC2217 capable.
.TP
.B 1, 2
Set the number of stop bits to 1 or 2 on io2 bits.  Ignored if io2 is
not RFC2217 capable.
