This is a random-ish list of things that might be done.

Add a way to stack multiple things on a mux.  Idea, use ",;" to
specify the start of a number of things to go onto a mux, ",," to
separate things on top of a mux, and ",." to mark the end of the last
thing on the mux. NOTE - The big problem with this is that there is
nothing to connect to on the top.

Implement RFC 1408 on telnet.

Add a "stream" option that tells the gensio to act as a stream, even if it's a
packet oriented gensio.  This will allow the gensio to add data to existing
untranmsmitted packets and do other optimizations.

Report an error if a mux or relpkt client tries to connect to a client.

serialdev devices cannot be used in a forked process because the UUCP lock
will not be correct.  However, flock locking solves this problem.

Port selector changes to openipmi.

Add 300 baud support to afskmdm.

Add 9600 baud

Add an aux data/ oob data for sent messages that is sent back to the
user of afskmdm.  This way, ax.25 can know when a packet was
transmitted and properly set the timers.

Add controls into afsk for controlling tx delay, tail, etc. and use
them from kiss.
