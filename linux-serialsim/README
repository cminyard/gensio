The serialsim device is a serial simulator with echo and pipe devices.
It is quite useful for testing programs that use serial ports.

This attempts to emulate a basic serial device.  It uses the baud rate
and sends the bytes through the loopback or pipe at approximately the
speed it would on a normal serial device.

It creates two types of devices.  Echo devices simply echo back the
data to the same device.  These devices will appear as /dev/ttyEcho<n>.

Pipe devices will transfer the data between two devices.  The
devices will appear as /dev/ttyPipeA<n> and /dev/ttyPipeB<n>.  And
data written to PipeA reads from PipeB, and vice-versa.

You may create an arbitrary number of devices by setting the
nr_echo ports and nr_pipe_ports module parameters.  The default is
four for both.

This driver supports modifying the modem control lines and
injecting various serial errors.  It also supports a simulated null
modem between the two pipes, or in a loopback on the echo device.

By default a pipe or echo comes up in null modem configuration,
meaning that the DTR line is hooked to the DSR and CD lines on the
other side and the RTS line on one side is hooked to the CTS line
on the other side.

The RTS and CTS lines don't currently do anything for flow control.

You can modify null modem and control the lines individually
through an interface in /sys/class/tty/ttyECHO<n>/ctrl,
/sys/class/tty/ttyPipeA<n>/ctrl, and
/sys/class/tty/ttyPipeB<n>/ctrl.  The following may be written to
those files:

 [+-]nullmodem - enable/disable null modem
 [+-]cd        - enable/disable Carrier Detect (no effect if +nullmodem)
 [+-]dsr       - enable/disable Data Set Ready (no effect if +nullmodem)
 [+-]cts       - enable/disable Clear To Send (no effect if +nullmodem)
 [+-]ring      - enable/disable Ring
 frame         - inject a frame error on the next byte
 parity        - inject a parity error on the next byte
 overrun       - inject an overrun error on the next byte

The contents of the above files has the following format:

 tty[Echo|PipeA|PipeB]<n>: <mctrl values>

where <mctrl values> is the modem control values above (not frame,
parity, or overrun) with the following added:

 [+-]dtr - value of the Data Terminal Ready
 [+-]rts - value of the Request To Send

The above values are not settable through this interface, they are
set through the serial port interface itself.

So, for instance, ttyEcho0 comes up in the following state:

 # cat /sys/class/tty/ttyEcho0/ctrl
 ttyEcho0: +nullmodem -cd -dsr -cts -ring -dtr -rts

If something connects, it will become:

 ttyEcho0: +nullmodem +cd +dsr +cts -ring +dtr +rts

To enable ring:

 # echo "+ring" >/sys/class/tty/ttyEcho0/ctrl
 # cat /sys/class/tty/ttyEcho0/ctrl
 ttyEcho0: +nullmodem +cd +dsr +cts +ring +dtr +rts

Now disable NULL modem and the CD line:

 # echo "-nullmodem -cd" >/sys/class/tty/ttyEcho0/ctrl
 # cat /sys/class/tty/ttyEcho0/ctrl
 ttyEcho0: -nullmodem -cd -dsr -cts +ring -dtr -rts

Note that these settings are for the side you are modifying.  So if
you set nullmodem on ttyPipeA0, that controls whether the DTR/RTS
lines from ttyPipeB0 affect ttyPipeA0.  It doesn't affect ttyPipeB's
modem control lines.

The PIPEA and PIPEB devices also have the ability to set these
values for the other end via an ioctl.  The following ioctls are
available:
 TIOCSERSNULLMODEM  - Set the null modem value, the arg is a boolean.

 TIOCSERSREMMCTRL   - Set the modem control lines, bits 16-31
			 of the arg is a 16-bit mask telling which values
			 to set, bits 0-15 are the actual values.  Settable
			 values are TIOCM_CAR, TIOCM_CTS, TIOCM_DSR, and
			 TIOC_RNG.  If NULLMODEM is set to true, then only
			 TIOC_RNG is settable.  The DTR and RTS lines are
			 not here, you can set them through the normal
			 interface.

TIOCSERSREMERR      - Send an error or errors on the next sent byte.
			 arg is a bitwise OR of (1 << TTY_xxx).  Allowed
			 errors are TTY_BREAK, TTY_FRAME, TTY_PARITY,
			 and TTY_OVERRUN.

TIOCSERGREMTERMIOS  - Return the termios structure for the other side
			 of the pipe.

Note that unlike the sysfs interface, these ioctls affect the other
end.  So setting nullmodem on the ttyPipeB0 interface sets whether
the DTR/RTS lines on ttyPipeB0 affect ttyPipeA0.
